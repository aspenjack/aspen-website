<br><br><p style="font-size: 25px; text-align:center">My innate curiosity, flair for creativity, and natural tendency toward structure and logic have paved the way for my career in data. After a meticulous six month Data Analytics course through UC Berkeley, teaching myself how to build my own website from scratch as a personal endeavor, and the various analytics/coding projects and visualizations I've undertaken to build my personal repertoire, I am ready to take root in a long term role where I can contribute my experience and skillset in a meaningful way.</p>
