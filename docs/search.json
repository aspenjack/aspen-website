Blending seamlessly with my proficiencies in Python, SQL, Tableau, Pandas, Excel, VBA, JavaScript, D3, HTML, CSS, and PySpark (to name a few), I am a natural problem solver, process improver, and critical thinker. After a meticulous six month Data Analytics course through UC Berkeley, teaching myself how to build my own website from scratch as a personal endeavor, and the various analytics/coding projects and visualizations I’ve undertaken to build my personal repertoire, I am ready to take root in a long term role where I can contribute my experience and skillset in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\nContact   LinkedIn   GitHub   Portfolio"
